\title{Get ALL outer neighbors for a concentric piece's OUTER edge}
\usage{
get_all_concentric_outer_neighbors(piece_id, rings)
}
\arguments{
\item{piece_id}{Piece ID}

\item{rings}{Total rings}
}
\value{
Vector of neighbor piece IDs (empty if boundary or center piece)
}
\description{
In concentric puzzles, inner ring pieces have wider angular spans than outer
ring pieces. This means an inner piece's OUTER edge may touch MULTIPLE outer
ring pieces' INNER edges. This function returns ALL such neighbors.
