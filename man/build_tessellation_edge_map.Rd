\usage{
build_tessellation_edge_map(
  adjacency,
  seed,
  tabsize = 20,
  jitter = 4,
  boundary_cells = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjacency}{Data frame with columns: cell_a, cell_b, v1_x, v1_y, v2_x, v2_y
Each row represents an edge between two adjacent cells}

\item{seed}{Base seed for reproducibility}

\item{tabsize}{Tab size percentage}

\item{jitter}{Jitter percentage}

\item{boundary_cells}{Optional vector of cell IDs that are on boundary}
}
\value{
Named list of edge paths, keyed by \code{"E<min_id>-<max_id>"}
}
\description{
Creates a map of all shared edges between adjacent cells in a tessellation.
Each edge is generated once and stored with both forward and reverse paths
for use by the two adjacent cells.
}
\details{
Edge keys use the pattern \code{"E<smaller_id>-<larger_id>"} to ensure
consistent lookup regardless of which cell queries the edge.
}
