\title{Map hexagonal direction to segment type and index}
\usage{
map_hex_direction_to_segment(dq, dr, piece, rings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dq}{Delta q (difference in axial q coordinate)}

\item{dr}{Delta r (difference in axial r coordinate)}

\item{piece}{Piece position data}

\item{rings}{Number of rings}
}
\value{
List with segment type, index, and direction
}
\description{
This implements the core geometric mapping between hexagonal piece
adjacency and the puzzle's path segment organization.
