\title{Trace SNIC edges between junction vertices}
\usage{
trace_snic_edges(boundary_segments, junction_vertices)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary_segments}{Data frame from build_boundary_segments()}

\item{junction_vertices}{Data frame from find_junction_vertices()}
}
\value{
List of edges, each with: cell_a, cell_b, vertices (ordered points)
}
\description{
For each label pair, chains boundary segments from junction vertex to
junction vertex. Each chain becomes one edge in the adjacency data.
