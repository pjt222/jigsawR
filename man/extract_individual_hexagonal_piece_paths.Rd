\title{Extract individual hexagonal piece paths (CORE IMPLEMENTATION)}
\usage{
extract_individual_hexagonal_piece_paths(puzzle_struct)
}
\arguments{
\item{puzzle_struct}{Complete puzzle structure from extract_hexagonal_puzzle_structure}
}
\value{
List of individual piece data with actual parsed paths
}
\description{
This is the heart of the "hard question" - parsing actual puzzle paths
and extracting individual piece boundaries using shared edge principle.
}
\details{
Key insight: Adjacent pieces share the SAME path segments, just traversed 
in opposite directions (like rectangular puzzles).
