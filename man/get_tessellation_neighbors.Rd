\title{Get neighbors for tessellation-based puzzle types}
\usage{
get_tessellation_neighbors(piece_id, puzzle_result, include_boundary = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{piece_id}{Piece/cell ID}

\item{puzzle_result}{Puzzle result containing adjacency data and pieces}

\item{include_boundary}{Whether to include boundary edges}
}
\value{
Data frame with direction, neighbor_id, is_boundary columns
}
\description{
Shared implementation for voronoi, random, and snic puzzle types.
Queries stored adjacency data to find neighbors and compute compass
directions based on edge midpoints relative to piece centers.
