\title{Compute fused edges for hexagonal puzzles}
\usage{
compute_hex_fused_edges(fusion_groups, puzzle_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{fusion_groups}{List of piece ID vectors, where each vector represents
pieces that should be fused together into a meta-piece}

\item{puzzle_result}{Output from generate_puzzle() containing piece data}
}
\value{
List with:
  - fused_edges: Character vector of edge keys that are internal
  - edge_to_group: Named list mapping edge keys to group indices
  - piece_to_group: Named list mapping piece IDs to group indices
}
\description{
Determines which edges should be fused (internal to meta-pieces) based on
fusion groups. An edge is fused if both pieces it connects are in the same
fusion group.
