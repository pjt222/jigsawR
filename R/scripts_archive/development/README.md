# Development Scripts Archive

This directory contains experimental scripts from active development work.

## hexagonal_work/
Scripts from developing hexagonal puzzle individual piece extraction:
- Analysis scripts: Understanding puzzle structure and paths
- Debug scripts: Troubleshooting specific issues
- Create scripts: Experimental implementations
- Extract scripts: Piece boundary extraction attempts
- Fix scripts: Bug fix experiments
- Test scripts: Testing various approaches

These scripts represent the iterative development process and are kept for:
1. Reference during continued development
2. Understanding the evolution of solutions
3. Potential reuse of specific techniques

**Note**: These are development artifacts, not production code. See main R/ directory for production implementations.
